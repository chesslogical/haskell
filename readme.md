To run this Haskell command-line application on a Windows system, you need to follow a few steps. First, ensure you have the Haskell Platform installed on your machine. This platform includes the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), GHCi (the interactive environment), and other essential tools. You can download the Haskell Platform from the official Haskell website.

Once the platform is installed, you'll need to install the cryptohash library, which the application uses to compute the SHA-512 hash. You can do this using either cabal or stack, both of which are package managers included in the Haskell Platform. To install cryptohash with cabal, open the Command Prompt and run cabal update followed by cabal install cryptohash. If you're using stack, run stack update followed by stack install cryptohash.

Next, save the Haskell code provided in a file named SHA512Hash.hs. You can compile this file using GHC by navigating to the directory containing the file and executing the command ghc -o SHA512Hash SHA512Hash.hs in the Command Prompt. This command compiles the program and creates an executable file named SHA512Hash.exe.

To run the application, simply execute the SHA512Hash.exe file. Open the Command Prompt, navigate to the directory where the executable is located, and type SHA512Hash. The application will prompt you to enter a string, and upon pressing Enter, it will display the corresponding SHA-512 hash value.

This process ensures that you can use the Haskell application to generate SHA-512 hashes on a Windows system effectively.
